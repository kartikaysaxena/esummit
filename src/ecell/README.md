## 👩‍💻 Contribute code or design

If you want to set up a local development environment, there are only a few steps either:

1. **💻 Clone this repository** using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) (you can also use the command line)
2. **🌐 Simply open the `index.html`** in [your browser](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) (no web server required since it’s all client-side :)
3. **✏️ Make some changes** using your [text editor](https://atom.io) and test them in the browser
4. 🚀 Use GitHub Desktop to create a branch with your changes, push, and open a pull request

And that’s it! 🎉 Contributing to other open source projects is very similar, so you know the steps already!
